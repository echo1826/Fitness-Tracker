# Description

This is a fullstack node application that involves the use of a mongoDB database, an express server, and HTML. The application involves the use of mongoose which behaves much like an ORM for a sql database. It is a fitness tracker that keeps track of the workouts you created and will display the total amount of weight and duration of the exercises on a chart. The user is allowed to create multiple workouts and the dashboard will keep track of the 7 most recent workouts created by the user. 

# Installation
